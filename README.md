Acceleration Data Acquisition
=============================

Some python classes and scripts to acquire acceleration data from different sensors (ADXL355 and LIS3DHH). Sensors are connected via SPI. To use the classes, spidev instances must be created first (see examples).

Examples were tested on Raspberry Pi 3B+.
